An open-source kit for agent development, integrated the powerful capabilities of Volcengine.

For more details, see our [documents](https://volcengine.github.io/veadk-python/).

## Installation

We use `uv` to build this project ([how-to-install-uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)).

```bash
git clone ... # clone repo first

cd veadk-python

uv venv --python 3.10

# only install necessary requirements
uv sync

# or, install extra requirements
# uv sync --extra database
# uv sync --extra eval
# uv sync --extra cli

# or, directly install all requirements
# uv sync --all-extras

# install veadk-python with editable mode
uv pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

We recommand you to create a `config.yaml` file in the root directory of your own project, `VeADK` is able to read it automatically. For running a minimal agent, you just need to set the following configs in your `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
model:
  agent:
    provider: openai
    name: doubao-seed-1-6-250615
    api_base: https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3/
    api_key: # <-- set your Volcengine ARK api key here
```

You can refer to the [config instructions](https://volcengine.github.io/veadk-python/installation.html#%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE) for more details.

## Have a try

Enjoy a minimal agent from VeADK:

```python
from veadk import Agent
import asyncio

agent = Agent()

res = asyncio.run(agent.run("hello!"))
print(res)
```

## Command line tools

VeADK provides several useful command line tools for faster deployment and optimization, such as:

- `veadk deploy`: deploy your project to [Volcengine VeFaaS platform](https://www.volcengine.com/product/vefaas) (you can use `veadk init` to init a demo project first)
- `veadk prompt`: otpimize the system prompt of your agent by [PromptPilot](https://promptpilot.volcengine.com)
